# Dictionary REST API test design

The purpose of this document is to give design ideas for the test suit that will be implemented to test the API.
Tests that verify the correctness of the underlying algorithms have already been implemented.

The main goal here is to test the functionality of the public API endpoints.

## Creation, deletion and listing of IEML terms from the dictionary

These operations are done by the following API endpoints:

- Creation:

- Deletion:

- Listing all the terms:

## Obtaining paradigm table related to an IEML term

## Operations related to relations between IEML terms
